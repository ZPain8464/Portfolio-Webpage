    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section>
      <h2>Hello,</h2>
      <p>My name is Zachary Painter and I'm a software developer living in Austin, TX.</p>
      <p>As a former content marketing specialist, I'm interested in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Web designs that are user friendly</li>
        <li>Code that is optimized for SEO</li>
        <li>Listening to my favorite jams while I sling JavaScript</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Please take a look at my site and feel free to <a href="mailto: z.painter45@gmail.com">Contact Me!</a>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Shortly after graduating college, I cut my teeth writing for online publications as a freelance writer. Eventually, I got into content marketing and picked up SEO working for different clients and companies.</p>
        <p>Working with SEO and content exposed me to HTML. I learned to troubleshoot basic on-page issues when uploading content to Wordpress, which piqued my curiosity about coding in general.</p>
        <p>As a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>, I've finally taken that next step to become a developer. It's been nothing short of an amazing journey so far! 
          <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer (or are looking for someone to collaborate with on an upcoming project), please don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
